Advent of Code 2022 daily challenges solutions in Python
[Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

In this repository, I am posting my solutions to these daily challenges every night after I submitting my code.
